# CSC 4100 Assignments

## The following are solutions to assignments from [Tennesee Technological University's CSC 4100 (Operating Systems) Course](https://catalog.tntech.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=4542) taught by [Dr. Michael Rogers](https://www.tntech.edu/directory/engineering/faculty/michael-rogers.php) in the Spring 2022 semester. The course was an expansion upon the previous assembly language course (CSC 3410).

<br><br>

### Each assignment was one step in completing a working operating system made in ASM and C, using a virtual machine configuration provided by Dr. Rogers. Each assignment folder contains boot1.asm (provided by Dr. Rogers), kernel.asm (the assembly language portion of the operating system), kernel.c (the C language portion of the operating system), and a makefile. The following are summaries of each assignment:

<br>

#### 1. dpharnden42_p1 - Learn how to create a working operating system that can print to the screen using ASM and C.

#### 2. dpharnden42_p2 - Add a process control block, interrupt descriptor table, and queue structure to the operating system, then infinitely loop through five processes.

#### 3. dpharnden42_p3 - Add a timer to each process, seamlessly interrupting and returning to the process in the order they were added to the stack.

#### 4. dpharnden42_p4 - Add priority to each process, ensuring that equal priority processes run simultaneously.
